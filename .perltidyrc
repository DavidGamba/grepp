# Recommendations

# IO Options
-b      # Backup original to .bak and modify file in-place
-ple    # Preserve the EOL character(s). E.g. in case Perltidy runs
        # on Windows, but processes a Perl file for Unix (and vice versa)

# --- Options listed from PBP on Chapter 2 ---
-sbl    # Opening sub brace on new line
-l=78   # Max line width is 78 cols
-i=4    # Indent level is 4 cols
-ci=4   # Continuation indent is 4 cols
-se     # Errors to STDERR
-vt=2   # Maximal vertical tightness
-cti=0  # No extra indentation for closing brackets
-pt=1   # Medium parenthesis tightness
-bt=1   # Medium brace tightness
-sbt=1  # Medium square bracket tightness
-bbt=1  # Medium block brace tightness
-nsfs   # No space before semicolons
-nolq   # Don't outdent long quoted strings
-wbb="% + - * / x != == >= <= =~ !~ < > | & **= += *= &= <<= &&= -= /= |= >>= ||= .= %= ^= x=" # Break before all operators

# --- Perltidy default options (in line with PBP and PCS) ---
-asc    # Add any missing optional semicolon at the end of a line
-aws    # Add certain whitespace to improve code readability
-tqw    # Default handling of multi-line 'qw' quotes
-ibc    # Indent block comments to same level as the code
-msc=4  # Minimum 4 spaces between code and same-line comments
-fpsc=0 # Don't try to line up all comments to a fixed column
-hsc    # Align hanging side comments
-sbc    # Enable static block comments
-nssc   # No special handling for static side comments
-dnl    # Delete old newlines
-bbc    # Ensure a blank line before every full-line comment
-bbs    # Ensure a blank line before every sub definition (except one-liners)
-bbb    # Ensure a blank line before code blocks (for, while, if, ....)
-lbl=8  # Minimum number of lines between each -bbb inserted blank line

# --- Additional options, based on PBP/PCS recommendations ---
-bar    # K&R style code braces
-nolc   # Long comments indented, even when this make the total line length "too long"
-noll   # Long lines indented, even when this make the total line length "too long"
-nola   # Don't treat labels as special cases when indenting

# --- Some other Perltidy options, intentionally not used ---
# The following Perltidy options are NOT consistent with PBP/PCS and should
# NOT be used:
# -lp, -icb, -fws, -nwls, -nwrs, -sfp, -sak/-nsak, -csc/dcsc, -fnl,
# -ce, -bl, -sbl, -bli, -blil, -bbvt, -otr, -sct, -boc, -kis,
# -pbp (because the -wbb list typo in the PBP book carried over to Perltidy
# (!))
# The following Perltidy options are not used, for other reasons:
# -sot, -mft, -cab, -bol, -bok/-nbok, -bot/-nbot, -iob, -isbc
